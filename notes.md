# Pitch to Note
The following table shows the voice pitch values which correspond in a "close enough to jazz" manner to (even temperament) concert pitch notes. The tolerance chosen is Â±11 cents, which isn't super in tune, but isn't offensive in most situations. Where there are two values shown, they are close to equidistant from being perfectly in tune, so either will work in most situations, but one will likely sound sweeter.

If you take only the vaules which are addressable by CC messages (that's even pitch values), with some values being replaced with "second best, but still acceptable" values, the table looks like this:
